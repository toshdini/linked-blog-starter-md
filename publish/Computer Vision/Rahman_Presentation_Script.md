# Barcode Scanner Project - Presentation Script
## Rahman's Section (5-7 minutes)

## 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello everyone, I'm Rahman, and I'll be presenting my contributions to the Barcode Scanner Project. My work focused on implementing the image upload functionality, developing robust barcode detection algorithms, and integrating with the Open Food Facts API for product information retrieval."

## 2. Research and Initial Setup (45 seconds)
"In the first week of the project, I conducted extensive research on barcode detection techniques and API integration:
1. Evaluated different barcode detection libraries and settled on pyzbar
2. Researched image preprocessing techniques for optimal barcode detection
3. Studied the Open Food Facts API documentation
4. Set up the development environment with necessary dependencies

This research phase was crucial as it helped us implement effective barcode detection and product information retrieval."

## 3. Technical Implementation (2 minutes)
"Let me walk you through the key components I implemented:

First, the barcode scanning implementation:
```python
def scan_barcode(self, image):
    """Enhanced barcode detection optimized for EAN-13"""
    try:
        # Scale the image if it's too small
        min_width = 640
        if image.shape[1] < min_width:
            scale = min_width / image.shape[1]
            image = cv2.resize(image, None, fx=scale, fy=scale)

        # Try multiple preprocessing techniques
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            if attempt == 0:
                processed_image = self.preprocess_image(image)
            elif attempt == 1:
                # Try with Otsu's thresholding
                gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
                _, processed_image = cv2.threshold(gray, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
            else:
                # Try with different blur and threshold
                gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
                blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)
                processed_image = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(blurred, 255,
                                                     cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C,
                                                     cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)

            # Try different rotations
            for angle in [0, 90, 180, 270]:
                rotated = processed_image
                if angle > 0:
                    rotated = cv2.rotate(processed_image,
                                       cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE if angle == 90 else
                                       cv2.ROTATE_180 if angle == 180 else
                                       cv2.ROTATE_90_COUNTERCLOCKWISE)

                # Try to decode barcodes
                barcodes = decode(rotated)
                if barcodes:
                    for barcode in barcodes:
                        barcode_data = barcode.data.decode('utf-8')
                        if len(barcode_data) == 13 and barcode_data.isdigit():
                            return barcode_data
```

Second, the product information retrieval:
```python
def get_product_info(self, barcode):
    """Enhanced product information retrieval with retry mechanism"""
    url = f"https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/{barcode}.json"
    
    for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=self.api_timeout)
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                data = response.json()
                if data['status'] == 1:
                    product = data['product']
                    return {
                        'company': product.get('brands', 'Unknown'),
                        'product_name': product.get('product_name', 'Unknown'),
                        'category': product.get('categories', 'Unknown'),
                        'image_url': product.get('image_url', None)
                    }
```
